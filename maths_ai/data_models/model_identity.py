"""Model identity of goal locals, kept apart from their execution identity.

A replayed goal is a new Lean context: its locals have new IDs, dense context
indices (the source may have gaps from hidden declarations) and sometimes a
renamed local. The model must still see the source context, because the
supervised data and vocabularies were built from it. So a canonical ``GoalLocal``
carries two identities:

- model identity: ``user_name``, ``context_index`` and the ``(:fv FVk)``
  labels inside the model S-expressions, which the graph and fingerprint read;
- execution identity: ``internal_name``, ``execution_name`` and
  ``execution_index``, the live Lean names that tactics and replay use.

``with_model_identity`` applies a source identity to a freshly replayed goal.
``carry_model_identity`` passes a parent goal's identity to the goals a tactic
produced: a local Lean kept (same internal ID) keeps its model index, and its
model name unless the tactic renamed it; a new local is numbered after the
locals before it with the same spacing Lean gave it, so a goal that needed no
mapping keeps Lean's own indices exactly.
